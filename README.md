A research done by [Pollstar](https://news.pollstar.com/2023/06/26/2023-mid-year-business-analysis-strength-in-numbers-mid-year-boxoffice-tallies-point-to-banner-year/) states that the average ticket price has increased more than 4 times since 1997. High service fee for ticket booking adds up from affiliated organisations some of which are part of the ticketing company itself.

With JamPass ticket selling is more transparent as it is on-chain. Currently, the largest ticketing company holds back the majority of the tickets to be sold for the resell market for a higher profit.

[Supporting stat: less than 25% of the tickets were released to the general public which could be as low as 7-8%.](https://ag.ny.gov/pdfs/Ticket_Sales_Report.pdf)

Ticket brokers can't buy tickets in masses manually or with bots in many cases with multiple accounts if JamPass is adopted. This is important because the majority of the tickets sold on the resell market are not from fan-to-fan but instead bought from brokers. 

[Supporting stats: professional brokers represent either the majority or the overwhelming majority of ticket sales on their sites.](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-18-347.pdf)
